1 - initialization
--choose algorithm

allocate simulator (should have a timer or clock)
alocate process manager
    parse csv
    add process to process table
        create a pcb for each process
    add to ready queue (based on the algorithm) if rr make it circular
    init blocked queue

allocate ressource manager
    create ressource struct for each ressource (mark them available)

allocate schedular
    (quantum if rr, null if non-rr)
    allocate execution queue


2 - run

take the first or next element from the ready queue
    -ordonnanceur make call to simulator which make the call to process manager to retrieve the pcb from ready queue then return it
    --schedular check if process need ressource if yes check ressource list if available, make it unavailable then run process if not push it to blocked queue
    *RR
        execute for the quantum

    *fcfs
        based on the arrival time ready queue should be sorted
        execute in order

    *sjf
        based on remaining time the ready queue should be sorted
        -preemptive : after each time unit sort the ready queue and take first element

    *priority
